         is defined as “false information that is spread, regardless of intent to mislead.
         Misinformation is first recorded in the late 1500s, and combines information with the prefix mis-, meaning “wrong” or “mistaken.” Mistake, misspelling, and misunderstanding are some examples of other common words besides mis- that use misinformation to mean “wrong.”

      <h2><center><strong><i>Disinformation</i></strong></center></h2>
      <center><img src="images/disinformationgrant750-1.png" width="30%" height="20%"></center>
      <center><audio src="audio/disinformation (1).mp3" autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" loop="loop"></audio></center>
      <p>is defined as false information deliberately and often covertly spread (as by the planting of rumors) in order to influence public opinion or obscure the truth
         Disinformation means “false information, as about a country’s military strength or plans, disseminated by a government or intelligence agency in a hostile act of tactical political subversion.” It is also used more generally to mean “deliberately misleading or biased information; manipulated narrative or facts; propaganda.”
         So, disinformation is misinformation that is knowingly (intentionally) spread.
