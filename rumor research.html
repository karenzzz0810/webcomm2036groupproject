      <li><strong>Early Research：</strong><br>
          In 1940, in America, rumors about World War II began to spread. The U.S. government was worried about these rumors, as there was a risk that they would affect the social unit of the United States before they entered the war (the U.S.A. entered World War II on December 8, 1941). To fight rumors that were deemed dangerous to civil morality and national security, the U.S. government decided to set up institutional committees; at the same time, social scientists began to study the phenomenon of rumors. Rumor Clinics were born in America (in Chicago, in 1942) as operating units of a larger project, known as the Rumor Project, that involved several government agencies and American universities. Using data collected by the Boston Clinics (1941-1942), every Sunday, the Boston Herald published the most famous rumors of the week, where the newspaper dedicated a column of the first page to dismantling the rumors according to the evidence from the facts. After their studies on rumors during the second war, in 1947, Allport and Postman publish The Psychology of Rumor. This study is considered by many as a milestone of social psychology, because this science came from the universities to become a science that deals with reality.</li><br>

         <strong>Recent Research：</strong><br>
         Social psychologists Nicholas DiFonzo, at the Rochester Institute of Technology, and Prashant Bordia, at the University of Queensland in Australia have collaborated on another important research project on rumour and rumour control. Their work has focused on sensory aspects of rumour at the individual level, such as a series of studies exploring how rumour is embedded in stable cause attributes that systematically influence perception and prediction. They have found systematic patterns in the content and level of individual involvement that are consistent with the theoretical notion that rumour spreading is a collective, problem-solving interaction that consists of a combination of anxiety, uncertainty and vulgarity.<br><br>
